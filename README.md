## Syllabus

### Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
This course will teach you how to build, train, and optimize machine learning models for regression and classification tasks using Python libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn.

- **Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Linear Regression**
  - Learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
  - Build a simple linear regression model.
  - Understand and implement the cost function and gradient descent.

- **Week 2: Multivariable Regression and Feature Engineering**
  - Train models using multiple features (multiple linear regression).
  - Improve model performance through learning rate tuning, feature engineering, and polynomial regression.
  
- **Week 3: Logistic Regression and Regularization**
  - Implement logistic regression for classification tasks.
  - Understand overfitting and how regularization helps prevent it.

### Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms
In this course, you will explore more complex models like neural networks and tree ensembles, and learn how to train and optimize them using best practices.

- **Week 1: Neural Networks for Binary Classification**
  - Build a neural network from scratch using TensorFlow.
  - Learn about vectorization and its importance for faster model training.

- **Week 2: Multi-Class Classification with Neural Networks**
  - Implement a neural network for multi-class classification using softmax activation and categorical cross-entropy loss.
  - Apply the Adam optimizer for efficient training.

- **Week 3: Model Evaluation and Tuning**
  - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Use learning curves and cross-validation to diagnose model issues like high bias or variance.

- **Week 4: Decision Trees and Tree Ensembles**
  - Build decision trees and ensemble models like random forests and XGBoost.
  - Learn when to choose between tree models and neural networks for different tasks.

### Course 3: Unsupervised Learning and Recommender Systems
This course dives into unsupervised learning techniques and how to build effective recommender systems.

- **Week 1: Clustering and Anomaly Detection**
  - Implement K-means clustering and anomaly detection.
  - Learn how to choose between supervised learning and anomaly detection.

- **Week 2: Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Recommender Systems**
  - Build a recommender system using collaborative filtering.
  - Implement a content-based recommender system using deep learning.

- **Week 3: Deep Reinforcement Learning**
